# Requirements

The following list of libraries is required:

`numpy`, `torch`, `torchvision`

# Run Training

For ResNet-18 SI + CIFAR-10 setup, please follow `experiments/drops_with_clean_cifar10/runs.ipynb` Notebook.
Then it is possible to get plots inside `experiments/plots_nips/resnet18si_cifar10_baseline/plots_rn18sic10.ipynb` Notebook.

* Use printed output commands to run necessary training. Adjust gpu settings accordingly to your hardware setup

* Use other cells to get intermediate pickles and information

# Plots

For Appendix plots, please refer to `experiments/ft_2_stages/runs.ipynb`, `experiments/long_train_2_phase/runs.ipynb`.

To obtain geometry plots:

* choose folder with setup inside `experiments/plots_nips/`

* follow instructions inside `li_runs_...` notebook

* follow instructions inside `plots_...` notebook
